 User Verification Sample

This code is a sample code for verification of a person using Support vector machine classification. Once the  I have applied data transformation(MinMaxScaler) and Grid Search cross validation with Pipeline. I have considered some feature selection methods like RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation),  RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and Orange and SelectKBest in order to select the best features which have the highest correlation and gave the highest score or performance of the model corresponding to the method I have used.
