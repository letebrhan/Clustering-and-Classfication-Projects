# Clustering-and-Classfication-Projects

1) Text Classification project: Data set Analysis for User Identification and Verification: Code description

This code is a sample code for verification of a person using Support vector machine classification. Once the  I have applied data transformation(MinMaxScaler) and Grid Search cross validation with Pipeline. I have considered some feature selection methods like RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation),  RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) and Orange and SelectKBest in order to select the best features which have the highest correlation and gave the highest score or performance of the model corresponding to the method I have used.


2) Text Clustering code description
In this code, I experimented with methods for clustering time-line items extracted from EMM news articles and I created a Gold Standard Data-set of Event Clusters, containing 312 GS clusters. The input attribute values used for clustering were Event Description, Text Snippet and Category. The clustering algorithm performance was evaluated using clustering assessment metrics and all metrics gave a satisfying score results for all the clustering algorithms applied in the code. All metrics produced higher values for clusters made of at least two items.
